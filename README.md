# ClinicalDataAnalysis
Diabetes Prediction Analysis
Overview
This project involves analyzing a diabetes dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various attributes such as gender, smoking history, and other health-related factors. The analysis uses a decision tree classifier model to make predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to a person's health, including:

smoking_history: Whether a person has ever smoked or not.
gender: The gender of the individual.
clinical_notes: Notes related to a person's health (which was dropped in preprocessing).
location: The geographical location of the individual (also dropped during preprocessing).
diabetes: The target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1 for yes, 0 for no).
year: The year the data was recorded.
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing

The dataset was first loaded and cleaned.
Unnecessary columns like clinical_notes and location were dropped.
Categorical variables such as gender and smoking_history were converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
The dataset was split into features (input variables) and target (the target variable, diabetes).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The relationship between the smoking_history and gender was visualized using a histogram.
A descriptive statistics overview was generated for the dataset.
Model Building

A decision tree classifier was used to predict the target variable (diabetes).
The model was trained using 80% of the data, and its performance was evaluated on the remaining 20%.
Model Evaluation

After fitting the decision tree model, predictions were made on the test data.
A results DataFrame was created to compare actual and predicted values.
A histogram was plotted to visualize the distribution of predictions.
Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: For numerical operations.
Seaborn: For data visualization.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning, specifically the DecisionTreeClassifier.
Results
The decision tree model was trained and evaluated, achieving an accuracy score based on the training data. Further evaluation metrics (such as confusion matrix, precision, recall) could be added for more detailed analysis.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to clean a dataset, perform feature engineering, and build a machine learning model to predict a medical condition. It also showcases how to use Python's popular libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

Future Improvements
Use a more complex model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to compare performance.
Evaluate the model using more metrics like the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Apply cross-validation for better model evaluation.
